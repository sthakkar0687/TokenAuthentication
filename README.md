# TokenAuthentication

Hello Everybody..!!

I have created an Application with JWT based authentication.
Service Pattern and Repository Pattern along with UnitOfWork Pattern has been implemented.
There is a Asp.net Core Web API (.netcore 3.1) and Angular(version 8) App for UI.
Unit Tests and Integration Tests are also implemented.

For using this application : 
1) Download the source code.
2) Change connection string in appsettings.json (of API project).
3) Build the application as it will restore the nuget packages.
4) Run command from package-manager-console - **update-database**.
5) It will create the database at mentioned server in connection string.
6) After that run both the Angular app and Api project simultaneously.
7) Register the User and Login post registration.
8) Have a coffee sip and enjoy the funtionality.

Thanks & Regards,
Sagar Thakkar
